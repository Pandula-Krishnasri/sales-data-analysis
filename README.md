🔍 Overview
This project focuses on building a Sales Data Analytics System that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Visualization to extract meaningful insights from sales records. The system aims to help businesses identify trends, forecast future sales, optimize marketing strategies, and improve decision-making through intelligent data-driven approaches.

By integrating advanced analytics with interactive dashboards, the system will empower organizations to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), customer purchase behavior, and product-level performance in real-time.
